				<p><span class="main-text">WHAT?</span><br>A simple site with a Soundcloud playlist of all the songs and sometimes even whole albums of upcoming artist that give me good vibes and listens. Music that is 'Bound to Happen.'</p>
				<p><span class="main-text">ROLE?</span><br>Creator, Graphic and Web Designer, Music selector.</p>
				<p><span class="main-text">WHY?</span><br>Life without music? No.</p>
					<p><span class="main-text">How?</span><br> I got into music more when I was around fifteen years old after my dad showed me MF DOOM and Dangermouse’s album “DANGERDOOM.” From there on I dropped the radio, which has gotten extremely worse since then, and started listening to actual music, music that if Beethoven came back from the dead he’d be like, “Damn that beat is tight!” I just let the vibes flow in.</p>

						<br>
						<p><span class="main-text">Any work in the field?</span><br>  Yes, I worked for a studio for a little bit, created their logo, you know their brand. </p>

				<p><span class="main-text">Graphic/Web Design:</span><br> We had clients come into our studio wanting to get their newest track recorded from us, us being the owner, our beats creator Baseboomer, and my good friend Nate Gibson, the sound engineer. After they recorded a song my part came into play, I’d design their album cover, t-shirt, business card, and anything else they needed. It was pretty fun, I really enjoyed being in there watching and listening to these people just pour their heart out into a song while in the vocal booth. The energy they put out was amazing, made me think about how awesome it most have been to see Biggie Smalls and all the classic Hip-Hop heros in the booth.</p>

						<br>
						
				<p><span class="main-text">Video with the studio?</span><br>Yes. I helped out a hand full of times film and edit music videos for clients, I inquiered film and edit skills through out my skateboard years. Filming skateboarding making skate videos.</p>
				
				<p><span class="main-text">Future?</span><br>I want to learn how to create music, I have some good ideas brewing.</p>
