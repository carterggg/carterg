				<h2>WHAT? Recycled Skateboard Jewelry</h2>
				<h2>ROLE? Co-owner, Graphic and Web Designer, and Jewelry Creator.</h2>
				<h2>WHY? For skateboarding.</h2>
					<p><span class="main-text">How?</span> Was in high school, skating a lot, started working with a friend creating graphics for his appeal company and I ran into this cleaned up version of a surfer, name was Mark Boltwood. Started skateboarding with this dude a lot and he helped my friend’s company advertise and get connections, he ended up being a jewelry making fanatic with a dream to create hand made jewelry out of broken and retired skateboards. So me being me, an eighteen year old kid with a weird mind and a dream of giving my creative skills an adventure and hope of success, I pushed him.</p>

					<p>Down the stairs into the hallway and told him to get into the elevator, we're on our way to the top.</p>
				<p><span class="main-text">Graphic/Web Design:</span> I do all of the graphic and web design work for the company, including tee shirts, stickers, banners, ads, you know, you name it. The largest percent of graphic work though, we offer custom engraving on all most all of our products, I create the design that the customer wants in a ‘clean’ 300 DPI black and white formatted vector image and from there we bring it to the lab and measure everything out, position the product perfectly, and engrave it. Never thought that engraving into the skateboard “plyz” would be one of the coolest things to look at.</p>

				<p><span class="main-text">Jewelry Creator:</span> 2K15, It is Mark Boltwood, myself, and a few other jewelry designers creating Boltz on Board jewelry. Mark Boltwood has taught me everything I know about it and now it is just a weird cool skill I have, to create jewelry out of wood, skateboard wood. I have skills in pretty much every wood designing tool from table saws to drummels, all the way to basic sand paper.
