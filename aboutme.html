				<p><span class="main-text">WHO?</span><br>Carter Guthrie at your service! Born and raised in the |||ATL||| area.</p>
				
				<p><span class="main-text">Education? </span>
					<br>- Grayson Technical School: Digital Media and Animation. 
						<br>- The Art Institute of Atlanta: AA in Graphic and Web Design 
							<br>- Watching and learning from my dad and the great designer he is. 
</p>
				<p><span class="main-text">WHY?</span><br>I love creating things, making nothing into everything, it’s a true passion.</p>
					<p><span class="main-text">How?</span><br>I was that kid that turned in his homework, tests, and notes with doodles all over them.</p>

						<br>
						<p><span class="main-text">Any work in the field?</span><br>  Yes, I worked for a studio for a little bit, created their logo, you know their brand. </p>

				<p><span class="main-text">Graphic/Web Design:</span><br> We had clients come into our studio wanting to get their newest track recorded from us, us being the owner, our beats creator Baseboomer, and my good friend Nate Gibson, the sound engineer. After they recorded a song my part came into play, I’d design their album cover, t-shirt, business card, and anything else they needed. It was pretty fun; I really enjoyed being in there watching and listening to these people just pour their heart out into a song while in the vocal booth. The energy they put out was amazing, made me think about how awesome it most have been to see Biggie Smalls and all the classic Hip-Hop heroes 'going in' in the booth.</p>

						<br>
						
				<p><span class="main-text">Video with the studio?</span><br>I inquired film and editing skills through out my skateboard years, filming my friends and myself skating and then editing them into videos. I actually thought about going to school for it. When I joined the studio's team they needed a few more helping hands in the video department so I ended up helping film and edit music videos for clients.</p>
				
				<p><span class="main-text">Future?</span><br>I want to learn how to create music, I have some good ideas brewing.</p>
